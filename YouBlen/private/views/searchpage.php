        <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>Hello, I’m Blen Michil, I’m a full stack developer at my school Media college Amsterdam.<br> I like building website’s and love playing games. In my free time I do sports (Kickboxing), or I will probably lie in bed and be lazy watching YouTube or a movie.<br> At Media College I follow the course Media developer, there I learn the skills that I need to become a better developer.<br> My course is 3 years long, it was 4 years, but the government needs more developer’s, so they shortened the time. I want to start a company later in life when i have more skills in development.
